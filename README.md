# Getting Started

If you are not sure where to start, consider the advice from the Gang of Four:

> If you aren't an experience object oriented designed, 
> then start with the simplest and most common patterns. 

(Gamma et al, 1994)

According to the Gang of Four, these are the simplest and most common patterns:

* Abstract Factory
* Adapter
* Composite
* Decorator
* Factory Method
* Observer
* Strategy 
* Template Method
