* Phil Haack on the Law of Demeter.
* Main benefit of LoD: Low coupling via encapsulation.
* "Rather than having a customer hand over his wallet to the paperboy, 
* "[instead have the] paperboy request payment from the customer."
* The LoD lets us use more than one dot, 
* ...so long as each dot returns the same object.
* Haack points out some places where LoD does not apply.
